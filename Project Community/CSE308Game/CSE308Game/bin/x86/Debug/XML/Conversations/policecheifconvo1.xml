		<Conversation value="Thanks kid, It's nice to see such enthusiasm, not mention respect for ones elders for a change. We need a police force here and we haven't been able to sustain one because of lack of training for people. I know your name carries some weight around here now, Convince 6 to join the police force. Look for those with blue hair and don't be surprised if they interrogate you." >
