		<Conversation value="Indeed. I was doing some research on a rather powerful plant capable of saving humanity from communists, AIDS, and drug addicts.  Unfortunatly I lost it while running from some Bonobos monkeys and you know what they're like... Retrieve the specimen for me and I might be able to give you a job as my research assistant." >
