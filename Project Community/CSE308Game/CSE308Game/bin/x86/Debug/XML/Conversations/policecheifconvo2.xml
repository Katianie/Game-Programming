		<Conversation value="I really appreciate all your doing for the town, and me. We have a 911 switch board but its in bad condition, I need you to get me 3 spools of 20 gauge copper wire, 1 power supply, and 6 LEDs. You should be able to find everything in the woods were the old semiconductor once stood.  I would go myself but those woods have communists in them and I have a family.">
