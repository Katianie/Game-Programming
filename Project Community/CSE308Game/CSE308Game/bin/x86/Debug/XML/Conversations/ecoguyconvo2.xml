<Conversation value="Thanks for coming through with these solar panels, they will be perfect. The great thing about solar panels is that they can store energy for later use like when its dark outside. Not to mention the free electricity from the sun. Do you still have time to help out?">

	<Response type="Convo" value="Sure, I'd be glad to help.">
		<Conversation value="Thanks for everything, we should only need this and then we can actually build the array. We need 1 capacitor to help hold the energy the solar panels take in. Let me know when you have it." >
